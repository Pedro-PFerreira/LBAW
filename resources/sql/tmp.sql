Sami stayed in front of me. I drove all the way to Boston just to give Tom a birthday gift. I''ve been doing this all morning. Sami didn''t know that he was dating a transgender woman. Tom probably isn''t going to figure out how to do that. Not all of the boys laughed at him. Tom never knew how much I loved him. The whole polyglot ghetto started to cry. We haven''t seen him since that time. She made her husband an apple pie. I still believe that doing that is ill-advised. Children are not allowed in. Mary may do that if she''d like to. Take a bubble bath. During the Bouteflika era, the Algerian government lost the trust of the people. Tom kept staring at me. I play the qanun. Yanni can''t survive on his own. He went all the way to see her, only to find she was away. Who is the oldest? I''m against that resolution. I didn''t know you had company. "Are you tired?" "No, not at all." Smoke from forest fires becomes so dense that airline flights must detour and residents across the region suffer respiratory illnesses. I think they''ll understand. Why don''t you ever talk to Tom anymore? I''m feeling sad for Melanie. I gave Tom a sedative. Mr Togawa was nominated for mayor. Thank you for informing me. Tom says he needs to find someone to do that for Mary. Tom said he thought that I might want to do that. It was hard to persuade him to cancel the trip. Why should I give you my money? I run 10 kilometers every day. Tom won''t be a good teacher. The show presented modern art from Europe. I feel like somehow I''ve stopped thinking of translation as something enjoyable. He claims he''s done that. Are all metals malleable? I believe you know them. Do you want some help or not? Mary doesn''t want to do that today because she''s sick. Her daughter disappeared seven years ago. Sami worked at different restaurants. I know Tom could do that today. He wields English well. Tom knew better than to ask such a stupid question. Decompression sickness, or "the bends," is a buildup of nitrogen bubbles in the bloodstream and other areas of the body. She''s a drama queen who''s obsessed with success. Don''t take longer than you need to and come back home quickly. I always rely on him in case there''s a problem. I hear you''ve quit smoking. He speaks English very loudly. I am ready to serve you. Even the darkest night will end and the sun will rise. Mary told me she''ll be back soon. Every pupil at this school must learn another foreign language besides English. You two can go. I''m offering you a deal. Have you seen the new car Tom bought? He started begging her, on his knees. An 18-year-old male is in hospital after an altercation at a party last night. To everyone''s surprise, Tom got up and started dancing. Tom told Mary that she needed to be finished doing that by 2:30. We know what you''re looking for. Tom wasn''t the first man Mary cheated.

Sometimes I have premonitory dreams. Today I want to eat something light. Have you ever wondered what it''s like to be a butterfly? Tom should tell Mary he doesn''t intend to do that. This is very cheap. Tom and Mary haven''t yet told us what they might do. I don''t think that I can be there by 2:30. Don''t listen to him, he misunderstood me! Could you help me by sending diesel? What can I do to help him? How old was Mary when she started walking? I never get to do anything fun. I sure hope Tom didn''t do that. A woman is not a creature that acknowledges the 100 things you''ve done right, but rather, one that without fail will point out the one thing you''ve done wrong. Eagles don''t fly in flocks. This is a reissue. You''ve got a vivid imagination. Tom said he''d be willing to do anything Mary asks him to do. How''s it coming, Tom? I think that Tom may stay in Australia for another month. You''re very dejected. You should give Tom permission to do that. She won''t be able to do it by herself, so we need to ask someone to help her. He had to withdraw. Tom and I seem to be the only people here. Do the computers work? I can do it again. If it is raining tomorrow, we stay at home. Every student of biology, anatomy, anthropology, ethnology or psychology is familiar with these facts. The room is covered with dust. A lot of people confuse Slovakia and Slovenia. How did that whole thing happen? This is the park where we said our last goodbye. I can''t tell you why I did that. I never thought I''d get married. By the summer of 1920, the Red Scare was over. Why did you need to do that? It''s fifty kilometers to Paris. Please give me this one and that one. I should probably do that. Tom gave his speech in French. Tom looked at it. How has no one come up with this yet? These conditions were not accepted. He didn''t have any idea what had happened to her. Tom didn''t stop yawning. It has to be done urgently. No one knows I''m polyamorous. Fracking is a type of geo-engineering to get oil out of shale. I''ve been told Tom and Mary are still in Boston. After studying French for three years, Tom could speak it fairly well. Tom told me that he was disorganized. Violent fires soon burn out themselves. He kicked John upstairs. This is all the money that I have now. Mary is quite careful, isn''t she? Would that I had met you then. I thought that Tom was innocent.

That was a brilliant deduction. I did not expect you to solve the mystery so quickly. Tom says he''d never do that again. I''m really not sure why. We all witnessed the unfortunate incident involving Tom. They''re not all violent. Tom was obviously dying to know. Tom isn''t going to quit. I had always supposed that Tom was innocent. He doesn''t like olive oil. I''ll consult with Tom. Ziri gave Rima medicine to save Walid. I asked Tom how long he had lived in Boston. Tom isn''t the only one who did that.

I have no faults. They are in the classroom. How much money can you spend? It''s backbreaking work. I did nothing last night. I just relaxed on the sofa! Sami came down. Mary started screaming at the top of her lungs. Mennad wasn''t able to tell his dad. Some Tuareg traditions are dying out. Tom told me that he had a plan. Cut off his hair. Ziri has his priorities. If you need help, you can reach out for us. It just couldn''t be true. Layla thought Sami was involved with somebody. Sitting still he tried to put his best foot forward. I won''t ask.

Would you just get out of here? Mary said that she was hesitant to do that. I didn''t believe that either. Tom still looks puzzled. I''m currently reading a quite thick book.

Combat soldiers during peaceful moments like to reminisce of their halcyon days. He used to be a professor, but now he is the dean. They have eighty dollars. What exactly are you planning to say? Tom can''t remember where he put his sunglasses. Yanni gave Skura a discount card. Their morale is high. I plan to cycle around Shikoku next year. The hunting dog headed for the woods. She was getting ready for leaving home. Sami was really worried about Layla. Tom had never used a washing machine before. He was involved in a murder case. I''m also going in that direction. The Algerian economy needs to be rejuvenated. I''m the only other person who should''ve done that. Tom said that Mary wouldn''t likely eat very much. I think that what you''re wearing is inappropriate. The child is sleeping. Just be quiet now! They dusted themselves off. Everybody except Tom knew he didn''t have to do that. Mary admitted she was lonely. Kate went to the party to see her friends. I saw you''ve posted a "for sale" sign. And where is that band who so vauntingly swore that the havoc of war and the battle’s confusion a home and a country should leave us no more! Their blood has vanished out their foul footsteps’ pollution. Who''s going to the airport to meet Tom? I promise that I won''t damage anything. I''ll be better in a minute. What''ll Tom and Mary do about it? How is your father? They lost their trust in her. Aren''t you busy on Mondays? I didn''t mean anything by that. I can’t wait for the pond to freeze so that I can ice skate with my cousins. I bet he isn''t telling the truth. "Where did you park your car?" "On the other side of the street." It is better to light a candle than to curse the darkness. You missed your chance to do that. He''s just talking to himself. Tom wasn''t the first one who said he didn''t want to do that. Tom knew exactly how Mary felt. Tom did that much better than I could have. Who looks after the children? Look at the reddish skies, the night is falling down. Is there any other method? Perhaps the words you said are convincing. He arrived here just now. He became a painter. Suddenly, a man stepped in front of them. OK, that''s enough for today. Does Tom know we don''t eat meat? The boss just chewed him out again. I''m not asking for your help. I don''t think that Tom could''ve done that without some help. The orbiting of Earth around the Sun obeys many complicated laws of physics. You made the same mistake. Tom was shirtless. Tom always seems to be depressed. ', 'TRUE');

The temperature on Mars can be very, very cold. Shaving your hair is better than ripping it off. Tom would like to see your essay after you''ve written it. I didn''t know that Tom was still in Boston. Discuss your educational background. Should I take this job? Tom''s favourite show is Black Mirror. Tom had three dogs in the backseat of his car. We haven''t eaten anything. Looking for the first time for the possibility to find a sentence by its number, I was a bit confused. But soon I realized: I first have to click on a single sentence, then I see the search bar on the upper right side of the screen. They say peanuts are aphrodisiacs. Hey pal. I just want to help you. Tom ran to catch the last train. I want to talk with my wife''s family in their language. I know Tom didn''t know that Mary could do that. Tom and Mary said they''d visit Boston. We weren''t ready for what happened. What are her true intentions? I don''t like being asked to do things like this. She was so beautiful that he could not turn his eyes away. That''s his best friend. Tom and Mary still haven''t told me the reason why they''re not going to do that. To me, written Finnish is reminiscent of Romanized Japanese. Why did Tom do something so dangerous? I told you she would pay for it. What goes around comes around. His dream is to go to a university abroad. Tom is going to eventually despise Mary, just like the rest of us. Tom told the police everything he knew. I wonder whether Tom knows that Mary wants to do that. Tom and Mary want to see us. The Maltese language is very similar to North African Arabic. I''d appreciate it if you could give me some advice. What does the thief look like? Dishonored: Death of the Outsider is the latest entry in the Dishonored franchise. Tom and Mary told me they had no money. This flower is the most beautiful in the garden. I ate as little as possible. I regret giving up. Ziri''s triumph didn''t last long. Steve was loved by all. Ziri loves it. You are the fastest. Mary has everything she needs to do the job. I''ll put you up for the night. Why shouldn''t Tom be in Australia? It''s not for everybody. They told me that they plan on going. At that time, I didn''t know what Tom was doing. He yanked off a few mint leaves and put them in his mouth. Tom rarely goes to bed before midnight. To our great disappointment, the game was called off. Tom said he doesn''t have very much money. It''s really snowing out there. It isn''t permitted. Tom bought the books he needed. Tom felt a pain in his back. Layla trusted Sami. Sami can''t outrun a dog. Everything is fine so far. Algeria has hydrocarbons. ', 'FALSE');

"You might come to our garden party on Wednesday fortnight." "Quite impossible," Arthur Berkeley answered. Mary insisted on her innocence. Tom said that he really enjoyed the concert. Put the package on top of the table. Tom wouldn''t complain. The Tuaregs slaughtered a goat in Yanni''s honor. Sami was angry at the world. Are we on the right road? I don''t want to live a mediocre life. No matter how he tried, he could not open the door. Tom says that he''d be willing to do that for free. Ziri and Rima went back to their hotel. Venus is the hottest planet in our solar system. We were angry, but we''ll be OK. Tom''s cat likes to chew on plants. Tom closed the door for Mary. You''re just the person we''ve been looking for. Tom says there''s no chance Mary will be fired. Tom said he''d stay and help us clean up after the party. My theory is that he followed Drebber as far as the Brixton Road. When there, a fresh altercation arose between them, in the course of which Drebber received a blow from the stick, in the pit of the stomach perhaps, which killed him without leaving any mark. Sami should stay here. Tom certainly should be careful not to make Mary angry when she''s holding a knife. Tom was burning with anger. I strongly suggest you stay out of Tom''s way. You have to let us help you. I go to the store to motivate my mom. We''re Tom''s grandparents. Ziri attended that hearing. Tom and Mary told me they were healthy. Maybe I ought to expand the memory. He''s a CPA, isn''t he? You''re the one who suggested that Tom do it that way, aren''t you? Is it hard? Tom said it''s no big deal. Tom wasn''t wearing a red tie. Today is Saturday and tomorrow is Sunday. I learned French from my parents. Tom endured the pain. Tom won''t be excused from doing that. For good or ill, there is no way but this to tide over the difficulty. Ziri took his father''s picture from under his pillow and started staring at it. I said I''d look after her. Everyone except Mary knew that she didn''t have to go to Boston. He knows his way around the city. Tom fed the sheep. Let the boys play. He has lived in Algeria for fourteen years but not continuously. I wonder whether or not Tom is in Boston. Ziri always left a window open. Tom and Mary are saving money so they can buy motorcycles.

A true scientist would not approach the question this way. Sami was still on the couch. Look at him move. Tom thought Mary lived on Park Street. The promise I made to you last week still holds true. It''s hard to get a taxi outside the station. Have any letters arrived for me? Tom isn''t still upset, is he? A raft of museums are now promoting online visits. That was cheap, wasn''t it? Mary''s husband''s name is Tom. The monsoon season seems to be dragging on this year. I''ll be waiting in Algiers. What made you think that I didn''t want to go? Ziri almost kissed Rima. He''s Muslim, not Arab. Protestors are rioting across the country in opposition to the war. She found him attractive. Yanni was stabbed multiple times. Don''t use the word "husband." Sami is the child of this house. They won''t have to do that themselves. The police will just take the money and probably won''t even look for the owner. I was breathing. Algeria opted for a different thing. I didn''t know Tom had relatives in Boston. I''m confused. Does Tom like or hate Mary? Did Tom eat the whole cake by himself? Before taking the measures you must take account of the difficult circumstances. Ziri was staying with Rima while his parents were on vacation. Ziri frowned. It''s all pretty simple really. You wouldn''t want Tom to do that, would you? We passed the time playing cards. I was all worn out. You should see your eyes. We don''t want Tom to get hurt. Tom was very angry with you.

Neil Armstrong was the first astronaut to walk on the moon. Tom has no idea. I was caught up in traffic. I''m not saying you can''t swim. I''m just saying I think you shouldn''t swim today.

I shared a pizza with Tom. The room has been trashed. Tom was early, but Mary wasn''t. Sami got caught in like six minutes. He was singing about Skura. Every creature is a word of God. I''d like to go back to Boston. Tom helps anyone that asks him for help. It''s our duty to do that. How''s it going at school? Tom cut himself with a razor. She seemed somewhat unsure of herself. It''s unlikely Tom will know what to do. ', 'FALSE');

He opened the window to let in some fresh air. Why didn''t you tell me you were going to leave early? He listened to her in silence. Tom tried to crawl under the fence. I didn''t figure out how to do that until just yesterday. I first met Tom right after he moved here from Australia. I don''t remember anything about my childhood. That wasn''t the only reason why Tom should''ve done that. Who runs the show? Mary admitted that she was overweight. Outside of a dog, a book is man''s best friend. Inside of a dog, it''s too dark to read. Tom said he was really glad he did that. It''ll be tonight. Come here, Tom. I hope that Tom doesn''t let us down. Tom and Mary said they thought doing that wouldn''t be a good idea. Ziri stayed in the car. Is it hard to eat with chopsticks? He isn''t my type at all. She is happy. There''s a snake in the garden. I don''t like popcorn without salt. How did Tom pay for all this? In reality, nothing was fine. Far from it. Everything was getting worse and worse. Doing that won''t be an option.

Around this proton orbits a single electron. I''ve made a shocking discovery. When you were a contractor, you were paid in advance, but when working for a salary, you will be paid in arrear. Sami stole from the job. I think Tom and Mary are going to do that soon. Isn''t that more like something a pervert would say? Not someone expressing their love. Tom has cold feet. Tom and Mary need to cancel their flights. She is more famous than you. Tom wasn''t asleep at that time. Marriages are made in heaven and consummated on earth. Tom had a shot rum. I wonder if we can do that without any help. I''ll say this: you won''t get anywhere by being angry with me. Mary said she walked home yesterday. Get her over here right away. I''m just glad to be part of it. Tom went outside to smoke a cigarette. That''s nice of you to say. It was in the safe. Ziri was powerless. The nurse gave the patient a jab. She''s in the room, isn''t she? Tom opened the box and looked inside. What would you like me to do for you? I know that you''re right. So long as certain parameters are met. Tom fell down on the floor. Tom doesn''t want to discuss this. Mary didn''t give up on her plan. I showed Tom who''s boss. Ziri has what it takes. Tom and Mary say they''re tired. Make sure Tom doesn''t go upstairs. Why don''t we start over? Bats are actually very lovable animals. Sounds like a pretty good idea, after all. Place the books on the table. Joanna has been in a bad mood and self-isolated for a few days now. Tom is trying to prevent that from happening. All men are mortal. Tom is a man. Therefore, Tom is mortal. He''s an animal. Don''t judge a man by his appearance. Tom and I have no one but ourselves to blame. I don''t like going out to have fun. Usually, I make my own coffee at home, and have a game of chess with a friend. I know what you guys are thinking. I don''t like Tom''s attitude. The cadres inspected our school. I don''t think that Tom is home on Mondays. Everyone knows Tom likes Mary. Let''s not speak French today. Call me once you''ve arrived. It was careless of her to go out alone.

Let''s get to the bottom of it. I''m Alan Tate, Terry Tate''s son. This job calls for skill. I don''t think that I''d like doing that with you. They look like they''re disgusted. Tom will go there with me. Who are these two boys? I''ll find something. Tom works every day except Sunday. I don''t have time for these little games of yours. I''m not the one who should be doing this. Who wrote these messages? I''m sure Tom meant no disrespect. Mary said that she wanted go swimming. Skura and Nuja came inside.

Many Algerians demand Islamic banking services. The pub was rammed. You''ll never have my psychedelic pencil! I don''t think that I''d want to do that. I must learn seriously. It''s a risk we took because we needed to. Tom pulled out his keys, but then he noticed the door was already unlocked. Is this your family? Sami immediately called authorities. Yanni was a kid. I wonder if it''ll snow. Yanni is a jerk. He wants to equip his son with a good education. Would you have been able to do it? I was disobedient. You didn''t tell me what you wrote on the parchment. Where is the bus stop? I turned on the lamp. He has started to learn Esperanto. Who wrote you this letter? I didn''t know that you were still in junior high school. Tom said he doesn''t think that he can win. Mary is kind of cute. Ziri posted that photo on Snapchat. Are you offering me a job? Can you give up your seat to old people even when you are tired? I''m not a psychiatrist. Is it OK to come again tomorrow? What do you plan to do about it? Send for the doctor at once, or the patient may get worse. Mr. Jackson''s lecture was boring. It could have been a lot worse. I''m sorry that I''m late, but I had a lot of things that needed to be done. He''s spirited, isn''t he? Tom doesn''t seem to know French. You''d be stupid if you did that. I poured myself another shot of tequila. People who whisper all the time can be very irritating. He brought forward a strong objection to my proposal. Tom said he didn''t want to help Mary do that anymore. Tom hasn''t finished the job. I''m sure Mary will tell us if she needs something. I don''t believe a word you''re saying.

Don''t be afraid to try that. I can see I''ve lost you. Sami hired a new bartender. I''m a married woman now. They calculated their expenses. Tom drank out of my glass. Skura and Nuja often do that. A cat is a miniature lion that loves mice, hates dogs and tolerates humans. Why do children have to carry such a heavy bag? Tom really wants to go. I''ll call Tom and apologize. Don''t get scared. I don''t think that''s going to happen. Mary is an activist. Tom said that he thinks that he''ll have to do that for Mary. Sami was the talk of the high school. Tom listened to the radio all day. Scurvy raged aboard the ship. I go to visit my friend in the hospital every other day. He''s your twin brother, isn''t he? Tom and Mary told John that they thought Alice was doing that right now. Would you mind giving me a hand moving this table? How wonderful that we have met with a paradox. Now we have some hope of making progress. I usually stay at business hotels.

You should tell Tom that Mary isn''t likely to do that. This is still fresh in Yanni''s mind. Tom was surprised that Mary recognized John after so many years. Sami learned that Layla was having an affair with his boss. I want to do that today. I knew Tom thought it would be a good idea to help Mary do that. I might be drunk, but I''m not crazy.
