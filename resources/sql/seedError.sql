Daily commodities increased in price. The cursing tongue is an indication of a bad heart. He is a man of faith. She has a great interest in music. He did not know that I understood Berber. Layla was unable to have children. Sami is the owner of the shop. Your lips are red. Tom doesn''t like the music I listen to. Yanni came to the mosque tired. All you need are your eyes; no binoculars or telescopes required. You must be thinking you''re the cutest person on the planet, huh? Sometimes I have trouble expressing myself. I didn''t eat much for breakfast. Life to her seems hard, as though there''s no future. I should probably tell Tom what he has to do. You were right about several things. However, you made a few errors. I need to drink water. I had a nice time in Boston. Tom hasn''t done what we asked him to do. I think that can be the case with a lot of things. There will be blood. Tom and Mary told me they thought it would be safe to do that. It wasn''t ours. I know those places well. Don''t you know how to fix it? I feel very honored. I should have told Tom to do that. I''m going to need more help. A man does not know what he is saying until he knows what he is not saying. Sami was driving down the street. During the holiday season, a lot of stores jack up their prices. Do you ever go swimming? With you here beside me I''m not afraid of anything. You''re my fortress. That''s the reason we need to leave. Tom is an old drinking buddy of mine. He is what we call a scholar. The minute or two Tom spent waiting felt like an eternity as he kept trying not to glance over at the car that brought him there, the other high schoolers in it staring at him while resting their feet on crushed beer cans and pizza boxes.

Tom said that he didn''t know why Mary didn''t like John. I guess you''re better than Tom. Yanni got his appendix removed. Layla realized that she was losing the battle. That''s the wildcard. We should go now, perhaps, to catch the ferry. How often does Tom set the table? Bird-watching sounds like it might be fun. Tom got down. I won''t explain to him anything. They live in a beautiful area. I was in Boston once. He wrote several plays in verse. He''s fat. What subjects do you like the best? I stood in line for more than thirty minutes. Peano is very important to the history of Interlingua because he developed a language very similar to contemporary Interlingua. Mennad started coming to. Tom has been accused of selling classified information. I didn''t think that Tom was as generous as he should''ve been. I wish that you''d stay in Australia a few more weeks. We could not play owing to the rain. Tom and Mary said they didn''t believe John really planned on going with us. Tom missed them. She did her homework. Have as much fun as you can! She realized she was going to die. I don''t know a thing about expensive watches. I was very, very lucky. The bus left the stop. Yanni and Skura started traveling together. Mary asked Tom to wait for her in front of the library. Tom didn''t show up today. You''re the stubborn one here. Puran Polis are made using jaggery. Mary is already old enough to do that by herself. I don''t think you realize how much I miss you. So the answer cannot be a simple rejection of global integration. Instead, we must work together to make sure the benefits of such integration are broadly shared, and that the disruptions—economic, political, and cultural—that are caused by integration are squarely addressed. I didn''t have the courage to do that. Tom and Mary each drank three cups of coffee before they left for work. It''s getting harder to find qualified employees. Sami was emboldened by his father''s presence. God''s tired of loving us. New questions will be asked and new debates will unfold. I''d like you to postpone your trip. Tom is afraid he might get deported. Ziri began yelling at the giant serpent. I''m impressed with your work. Tom said he doesn''t even want to think about it. Did I see someone waving to me or did I imagine seeing a hand waving? I thought Tom was embarrassed. Tom got carried into the locker room. You''re secretive. Do you ever talk to Tom? How many years have you been teaching children to swim? All happiness is based only on the relationship between what we hope to get and what we get. I didn''t know where Tom had gone. I wouldn''t trade places with anyone in the world. I have another year at high school. Tom''s mother used to wash his clothes for him, but she doesn''t anymore.

The trial ended in a hung jury. Tom wasn''t provided for in his father''s will. Do you want me to put him on the phone? He has collected twice as many stamps as I have. There are lots of people who like to be by themselves and never feel lonely. I talked to Tom about that already. It was a surprise. Breakthroughs in medicine and bioengineering will truly be human achievements when everyone has access to their benefits and cease to be a privilege for the few. It can''t get any worse. We looked for the puppy, but it was in vain. Leave me alone and let me do my job. We''re weak. Everybody probably thinks I''m crazy. Tom doesn''t want to let Mary go. In his Epiphany homily Monday in St. Peter''s Basilica, Francis encouraged people to focus on serving others, not themselves. Mary hasn''t lost as much weight as she says she has. I don''t know how to use chopsticks. It looks like everyone has left. I guess it''s time to go. I didn''t think anybody would actually do that. Tom gave Mary what little money he had. They said they wanted to do more. The party was a lot better than I expected. To begin with, we find it unacceptable that he has not received the journalists. I just got in my car and drove. You should not have said that. Sami took good care of the girls. There are many Mexican restaurants in this part of town. It''s always hot this time of year. His friends were jealous. Mary is much faster than me, isn''t she? Not all cats are black. Mary looks good in that red dress. She stuck her fingers in her ears. Hey, Tom, when did you get here? Mennad was screaming. I never get tired of watching Tom and Mary play darts. It all worked out well. Tom is a firearms expert. He made an admirable speech about protecting the environment. I''m still hoping we can solve this problem. The discovery of the tiniest bacteria-like or virus-like organism outside the Earth would be only the tip of the iceberg. It would be a "miracle" as it is. Tom and three of his friends went fishing last weekend. Tom, too, was in the car. We have no idea what to do.

I suspect that Tom doesn''t need to do that anymore. I don''t feel like I deserve this. Neither Tom nor Mary has a lot of work to do this week. I haven''t stopped doing that. I just saw one. He could make his way in life. Ramadan is the holy month of Islam. Ziri is proud of you, guys. I doubt that Tom would be interested in joining the army. Tom thought Mary would like doing that. Tom and I study French together. I don''t have to do anything. Have you ever been on a ship? That''s not funny! Ziri saw an old computer in the corner. Tom adopted our idea. Fiona''s letters gradually came less and less. Layla got a babysitter for her children. He is not the active person he used to be. Mary told me she was terrified.

You spend too much time worrying about things that don''t matter. Enjoy the moment. The house is unoccupied. Tom picked up the helmet and put it on. I''m meeting Tom in an hour. It''s not racism, it''s the pure truth. Mary said she thought she knew what had caused the accident. You are very kind, ma''am. Is that the best Tom can do? No, these notebooks are not mine. Acceptance of the document occurs only by mutual agreement of both parties. I feel pity for you, you poor woman. Indigenous Australians have eaten kangaroos for millennia. Where do I go then? He looked very young. Layla was dating that other guy. She sat down, sighing. He hypothesizes that there might be a ninth planet in the Solar System. This statement is slanderous! Are you coming to the concert with me? Layla is a hairdresser. I never should have left you. I''m older than both of you put together. We''re having company. Tom has decided he isn''t going go to Boston next summer. Tom is the bassist in our band. Yanni makes baskets with willow rods. Sami didn''t want to tell Layla his name. I came in view of the castle. The wages of sin is death. I''m learning to speak Spanish in Argentina. I intend to come with you. Sami does YouTube just for the money. You like to hurt to the people. Tom said he wished that he hadn''t been there. The longer I stay there, the more I like the place. Mennad and Baya don''t know what they have in common. You shouldn''t have told Tom that you did that. I hope Mary did what Tom told her to do. I suspect Tom and Mary have been sick. That''s not ready! Was Tom here when it happened? That''s worth investigating. That''s what we''ll be discussing today. Tom asked Mary about it. In the raining morning of the 30th of January of 2022, at the cafe, I was drinking my iced black tea. My friend Don walked to a front table, as we discussed his electronic-book reader, which he has had for over ten years. I have a similar device. Later, a handsome black-haired bearded man, maybe an Arab, approached the counter. He was wearing a black T-shirt and grey rugby pants. He had very hairy arms. Afterwards, I went to the pizzeria. That was the first time Tom ever kissed me. Tom couldn''t hold a job. Mary can come, too, if she wants to. I''m only telling you this because I''m your friend. I wasn''t able to find a babysitter on such short notice. She said she didn''t mind. Mary spared her effort. Mary lost her son in an accident. It''s obvious Tom isn''t used to living on a tight budget. I wanted to ask Tom what he''d been doing. Outside, it''s cold and wet. We are all united in friendship.

Tom and Mary sold some of the potatoes they''d bought to John. Do you know any good sites for studying languages? What''s the best career advice you''ve ever received? Tom is one of the most intelligent men I''ve ever met. Lidya and Mira weigh more than Skura does. These events unleashed a brutal repression in Egypt. Get me any information you can about Tom. They couldn''t figure out why I was sad. That isn''t why Tom didn''t win. She gave her heart to him. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines binge drinking as a man consuming five or more drinks in about two hours; four drinks for a woman. Tom emptied the trash. Where''s Lanzarote? Sami''s grades dropped. Lizards are more closely related to humans than to salamanders. Are you looking for an interpreter? Is it all under control? Sami''s birthday was six days after Christmas. Sami didn''t know that Layla''s dad was abusive. Tom has to take a French test. Tom said that it wasn''t likely to happen again. Our store won''t be open on Thanksgiving. I didn''t want to tell anyone anything. Mary said she likes teaching French. It is a song. I know Tom and Mary have never gone to Australia together. Tom thought the story was amusing. Ignorant people think they know everything, and knowledgeable people think they''re ignorant. Where''s Tom''s school? No further details were available. I didn''t give anything to him. I jumped into the back of the pickup truck with Tom. Tom and Mary gave me this before they died. I wish I had my own studio. Have you read the Lord of the Rings trilogy? I filled in my own name on the form. Tom is an adventurous boy. His idea seems feasible. Ziri''s door slammed shut. I know several good places to eat. Tom said that he hadn''t seen anybody. I can''t express myself in French very well. I felt like doing that yesterday. I''d feel the same way if I were in your shoes. Sami ate the bug. Do you think Tom is still downstairs? If I get rich, I''ll buy a castle. I don''t think Tom knows what Mary''s favorite flower is. On his way to work he bought a new tie. I''m looking forward to that day. If you eat that much, you''ll get sick. Tom drove into a parked car. At this time, we should wipe out crime and collusion. Build me up and don''t tear me down. Why doesn''t he love me anymore? Let''s go ask him.

Tom should probably tell Mary what he has to do. I understand you well. He came home from school. He ran back to his car. Tom is down. Tom used to be a teacher. Tom didn''t hear his name being called. Tom was always a dreamer. She threw herself at him and kissed him passionately. Here are the books. Bob and Hank are duking it out in the alley behind the bar. At first, I thought Tom was sick. My wallet no longer has money. Oh, how wonderful it is to know! Doing that was much harder than I thought it would be. Tom is forgetting something, I think. I''ll do whatever has to be done to make sure Tom does that. Tom is telling the truth, isn''t he? It''s really boring. He has a beautiful young wife. I met an ear nose and throat doctor at a party on Sunday. Revolutions have never lightened the burden of tyranny: they have only shifted it to another shoulder. Do you know her at all? Tom is happy with his new job. Guess. Just promise me you won''t do that until I get back. How is that relevant here? What''s the name of this film? Tom didn''t give me a chance. I thought that Tom didn''t eat meat. The audience is really charged up. Mary did that because she had to. I know Tom knows that he''s not supposed to do that. It was after four years that the war came to an end. Tom is in Boston doing that right now. You want to learn Japanese, so I suggest you visit Japan. I don''t want to see anything else. This example sentence was deleted. Ziri had nothing to say. Maybe Yanni is right. Sami was still holding Layla''s hand. Tom and Mary said that they felt no pressure to win. The dog is infested with ticks. When the rain had stopped, the birds began to sing again. He was entranced with joy. Sami was adopted as an infant by Farid and Layla Bakir. I''ll have to tell Tom about what we just discussed. I suspect Tom won''t want to do that tomorrow. "And where are the bosses?" – "At dinner". Every positive integer has exactly one successor. Tom and Mary told me they felt better. Tom knows that Mary is planning to go to Australia. Tom picked flowers. We''ve tried all the puddings, and this one is clearly the best. How may I be of service? Tom got caught trying to steal a bracelet. Mary can''t decide when she should leave. We lived in a cramped, dim house which was as small as a hive. Tom didn''t even try to help Mary. I don''t think I''m going to do that anytime soon. The man who lives next door is a pretty good clarinetist.

I have to attain my purpose at all costs. Tom convinced me to learn French. This stays between us, OK? In 2013, Tom moved to Australia. I don''t think that I''d let Tom do that by himself. I sincerely hope so. Ziri is a football coach. Didn''t you know Tom and Mary are actually very smart? Tom opened his bag. Do you have any more questions? Yanni called Skura a liar.

I also tend to omit the comma in short sentences. He said that he would do it. That isn''t how we''re supposed to do it. It was clear Tom was the one who was going to do that with Mary. That''s not what we want. It was a long, difficult night. Tom ate the cupcakes I was going to give you. Why don''t we see how Tom is doing? Please give me a pillow and a blanket. They were nowhere to be found. It wasn''t my suggestion. We won''t do that today. Mary poured herself something to drink. Tom is a diplomat. Somebody ate all the biscuits. I can''t believe I never got to know Tom while we were classmates. We simply can''t just leave Tom here by himself. Does it sound good to you? We have five kinds of kebab. Their job is done. It will be to your advantage to study hard now. Ziri drives a Volvo. He bought eggs and milk from a farmer. The referee is calling for a corner kick. You''re a foreigner, aren''t you? He turned his back on her. We hope you all have a lovely evening. His ties were always wrinkled. Tom eats rice every day. I do not suffer from megalomania. Great people never have it.

Yanni went straight home from there. I want to join the school orchestra. What''s your favorite NFL team? Which kind of watch do you prefer, digital or analog? I longed for something unattainable. Tom said he didn''t think he could do that by himself. I hope that our plane leaves on time. They saw a cat climbing up the tree. My Latin teacher used to look down sternly on me over the rim of her glasses, but now I know it only had to do with the fact that she was wearing reading glasses and that she will have found it a nuisance taking them off all the time, so what looked like contempt towards us students might well and truly have been kindness.

I didn''t know Tom knew who was going to do that with him. I am rubber and you are glue. Your words bounce off me and stick to you. Tom may need to wait. I saw Tom get out of the taxi. I''ve heard that Boston is a dangerous place. Is that true? "I got fired." "Again?! You''re worthless." Tom reminded me to buy some milk. Who are you to tell me to get out? I''d rather not. Do you think I''m cool? The bird flies. They aren''t serious about their studies. Tom was reading about Australia. Sami already told me. Tom went to the prison to visit Mary. The crazy thing about life is that you live for the future, only being able to understand the past. Tom will be intoxicated by the time you arrive. Tom has been waiting for Mary to do that for him. I have lived in this village for the past ten years. Birds are pecking at the grounds. Tom is busy writing the report now. I still think Tom is a sexist. Sheltered by a tarpaulin from the blazing sun, a group of Kenyan women weave handfuls of dried reeds, their practiced hands turning them into exquisite baskets, mats and hats that have been sold to tourists from around the world. What flavoring did you use? I don''t trust the television. Emily asked a question. Sami needs to know a little bit more about Layla and her background. Islam spread quickly in North Africa. We need three cups. We''re going for a stroll round town. I''m afraid there''s a little problem. My friend Bratislav told me that he felt like a "weird kid" growing up. I replied by saying that I too was a "weird kid." Are you certain Tom cheated? We need Tom''s money. You should trim your fingernails. The day was beginning to break. I really want to see Kumiko. I suppose that''s one of the reasons Tom and Mary aren''t here.

What''s wrong, Tom? There''s tea; I drank it; I''m happy. Tom and I know each other pretty well. Tom was careful not to leave any evidence. This is not fun. And we gave it to you to drink. If you come, he''ll come too. Hashimoto will tell me the news. Now don''t be frightened. He began talking. We had to compromise. She told me she was wealthy. Tom posted a notice on the wall. Mary said she''d appreciate it if you wouldn''t do that anymore. Close her locker. Tom couldn''t remember what he had done. Do you have plans for additional education? Mary paid someone to do that for her. It doesn''t matter what I like. Tom nodded toward the door. Mary said she didn''t want to play tennis with me. Tom said he did that as quickly as he could. Ziri wants a partnership. I was raised well. Tom works at night. How many trips did you make? Sami was paid under the table. It isn''t exactly a secret. It has suddenly gotten cold, hasn''t it? His behavior puzzled me. Tom doesn''t like going to the beach. What colour is the car which she bought for herself? I guess I should''ve asked you out to dinner. Tom and Mary aren''t so confident.

"Yanni is out of jail." "God be with us." Tom has a criminal history. I could barely walk. Can cats have salami? He''s not perfect. Everybody has his or her own idiolect of each language that he or she knows. My own English idiolect is weird for some. In speaking, I choose a variety of accents, depending on the listener. When I speak English to Filipinos, I try to use a more Filipino-accented English, because it is easier for them to understand. When I speak to a Canadian or American, I shift to a more North American accent. In writing, I learned the American way until age 10 in the Philippines. From age 10 and above in Canada, I learned Canadian English writing, up to university level. My appetite for science fiction and fantasy books from both American and British authors has affected my writing style. Some Cantonese opine that my writing is British, and it reminds them of England. My philosophy is that English is an international language and its origin can be divorced from its essence, as the case, I think, also of Spanish and French. Ergo, I urge Cantonese to divorce the essence of English from its land of origin. My favourite English writers are the British sci-fi author Olaf Stapledon and the American inventor-philosopher Buckminster Fuller.

Tom said that he thought Mary was planning on going to Boston with him. It was fun watching Tom doing that. May I borrow this CD? They wanted to learn Berber. He gave up the plan for economic reasons. Yanni''s street was all taped off and teeming with police officers. She said that she was fine. A book can be exciting. Did Tom tell you anything interesting? One of the girls smiled at Tom. Mary didn''t invite Tom to her party. Tom and Mary weren''t told they didn''t need to do that. I don''t speak French as fluently as Tom and Mary do. He is too skinny that his pants are slim like threads. Tom won''t drive to Boston. She''ll be ready. Just tell me what you''d like me to do. I wonder whether or not Tom is rich. Tom said he''s thinking about taking a vacation. Tom says he hopes that you''ll be there. This mink cost $3,000. Tom wasn''t lying down. Tom created a website for Mary. Sami was so livid. Tom and Mary admitted that they weren''t really the first ones to do that. Islam has a solution to this problem. It rained yesterday and the day before yesterday. He looks stern, but actually he''s very kind. They have failed. I cry a lot. God is merciful. It''s quiet, you know. We''re a little disappointed. I have dual citizenship. Tom said that he didn''t have any plans for next weekend. I raced him a mile. I don''t enjoy swimming laps. Sami''s dog is snarling. Tom said that he hoped that Mary would do that. It is much easier to rest on the bicycle by slowing than to dismount. Tom wasn''t the first person to enter the room. They used their guns to hit each other. I didn''t know Tom no longer needed to do that. Nothing is going his way. That''s not what I expected to hear. Try to look on the bright side. Tom said that you needed a job. I refuse to listen. "It''s time to stop procrastinating." "I''ll stop later." I listened to the boring lecture for what seemed an interminable fifty minutes. He is a member of the football club. Tom and Mary said they didn''t have enough money to buy a car. There’s no time! Tom and Mary don''t want to help out. It was Tom''s idea. He was in charge of the fundraising efforts. We have three cats, a black one and two white ones. Tom made me read this book. My dog sometimes eats grass. Tom doesn''t think Mary will be busy next week. Trump is in his seventies now. Sami is watching this video right now. We don''t want you to go to Kabylie alone. We''re going with you. I''m looking forward to your reply. He told me that he wasn''t injured. Tom and Mary said that they felt humiliated. You may have to do that by yourself. The American Civil War is the main theme of the book. It so happened that I had no money with me. You know that you were right. I want to be back in Boston. We are exaggerating. I don''t think he wants to marry you. It was terrific. The nun''s duty is to water the flowers and the cauliflowers. Tom took a sip of his wine. Tom should be able to solve the problem by himself.
